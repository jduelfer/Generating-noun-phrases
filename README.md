# Generating-noun-phrases
Generating noun phrases according to the grammar of a two year old child. When running the code, it will produce a "grammatical" sentence
such as that a two year old child might say. This is done by analyzing the grammar of the two year old child and then creating an FSA
which produces a randomized collection of words. This is going to continue into a future study of random, grammatical sentence creation.
